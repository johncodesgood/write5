Nitewriter

======
Description

Nitewriter is an easy to use Rails 4.1.6 application designed to incentivise writers of any and all kinds to write regularly through the power of positive peer pressure.

Usage

Nitewriter uses Facebook login for account creation. During account creation users take a short survey to regarding their thoughts of United States politics and global warming. Users also provide a cell phone number for a "watcher".

Users are able to set a daily word count that they are obligated to meet 5 times over the course of the week. If the user does not meet the mark the user is "shamed". Nitewriter will post their lack of progress to their Facebook wall as well as send a text message detailing their progress to their watcher by way of the Twilio API.

The Future

Nitewriter is an ongoing project. Future plans include the inclusion of a more robust text editor, Twitter integration, a full featured blogging platform.
